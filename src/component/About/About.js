            <p>Islam is the fastest growing religion with over 1.8 billion followers all over the globe.

                By now you probably heard about Islam through the media, conversations with a friend or coworker, or perhaps you stumbled upon it while browsing through the web. Although Islam is the second most followed religion in the world after Christianity, it is also one of the most misunderstood.

                It can be overwhelming to discern the differences between what Islam truly teaches from the misinformation and misconceptions that are widespread. We created this guide for anyone who would like to know what Islam is really about from an authentic source.</p>
